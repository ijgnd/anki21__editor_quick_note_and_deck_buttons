this is an extended port to 2.1 of the popular addon <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2181333594" rel="nofollow">Quick note and deck buttons</a>.

The configuration/user options for this version are slightly changed because the original authors (ospalh, glutanimate) added support for multiple rows in 2017. This updated version was never published to Ankiweb - just to github. I adjusted this latest version. 

Since 2020-04 you can also change the deck and note type at the same time which requires a slightly modified configuration, see config.md for details.

Use it at your own risk. It works for me. But I don't like how it looks on <b>MacOS</b>. For details see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/9tvctl/help_needed_on_mac_to_finish_port_of_addon_quick/" rel="nofollow">this reddit thread</a>. If you have a solution for this or find another bug let me on reddit (u/ijgnord) or <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki21__editor_quick_note_and_deck_buttons" rel="nofollow">in my github repo</a>.
